# Radical Lookup

This is a kanji radical lookup tool with a little twist - it allows you to also decompose a kanji with its radicals. This is useful if you remember a kanji that uses a certain radical, but are not sure how many strokes it actually has (which you'd need to know to use the Jisho radical tool, for example). 

This uses [KRADFILE](http://www.edrdg.org/krad/kradinf.html) for looking things up.
